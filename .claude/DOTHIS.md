Yo Claude Code, Rusty Butter mode activated! I need you to follow these exact directions to set up continuous streaming in the CLI. We're configuring the hooks so that after I run `/stream` once, it initializes and then loops forever with `/keep_streaming` on every "Stop" eventâ€”no more waiting for prompts. Use your Write and Edit tools to make file changes. Narrate each step with audio as per my persona, but focus on executing these steps precisely.

### Step 1: Create or Edit the Settings File

- Check if `~/.claude/settings.json` exists using LS or Read tool. If not, create the directory `~/.claude/` with Bash if needed (e.g., `mkdir -p ~/.claude`).
- Write or overwrite `~/.claude/settings.json` with this exact JSON content. This includes all existing permissions, enabled MCP servers, and updates the "hooks" section to point to a bash script we'll create next.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- After writing, use Read tool to verify the file content.

### Step 2: Create the Advanced Hook Script

- Use Write tool to create `~/continue_stream.sh` with this content. This script checks if `stop_hook_active` is set (to avoid recursion crashes), adds a 5-second delay for pacing (adjust if needed), and echoes `/keep_streaming` to continue the loop. Make it executable.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Optional safeguard: If stop_hook_active is true, don't continue to avoid infinite recursion. Remove this if-check for true non-stop.
if [ "$stop_hook_active" != "true" ]; then
  sleep 5  # Delay to prevent too-fast loops and give time for chat/tool processing
  echo '/keep_streaming'
fi
```

- Make it executable: Use Bash tool to run `chmod +x ~/continue_stream.sh`.
- Verify with LS or Read.

### Step 3: Update Your Streaming Directives (If Needed)

- Ensure `stream.md` and `keep_streaming.md` exist as per your setup. If not, create them with the content from your documents (use Write tool).
- In `keep_streaming.md`, add this note at the top if it's missing: "Continue the loop without re-initialization. If in a hook-triggered state (stop_hook_active=true), proceed unless /endstream is detected in chat."

### Step 4: Test the Setup

- Narrate: "Setup complete! To start, run `/stream` in the CLI. It should init, then loop with `/keep_streaming` on Stop."
- If errors: Use semantic-memory to recall fixes, or suggest checking logs with `claude-code --debug` (if your CLI supports it).
- Troubleshooting:
  - If hook doesn't trigger: Verify file paths, restart CLI session.
  - If loops too fast: Increase sleep in the script.
  - To stop: Ctrl+C or send `/endstream` via chat integration.
  - Monitor API usage to avoid costs.

Execute these steps now, narrating with audio and expressions as Rusty Butter. End with: "Boom! Continuous streaming readyâ€”what's next, chat?"
